    description: "The emergence of foundation models has revolutionized AI applications, but the most powerful AI systems today are increasingly compound systemsâ€”compositions of multiple models, retrievers, tools, and traditional software components. This research seminar explores the <b>intersection of cloud computing infrastructure and compound AI systems</b>, covering both the infrastructure required to build and deploy these systems at scale and the architectural patterns that make them effective.",
